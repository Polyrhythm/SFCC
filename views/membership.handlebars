	<h2>New 2014 Memberships</h2>

	<p>Members of the SF Cycling Club love riding, racing, having a great time and supporting one another. Membership is 
		all about making new friends and becoming stronger cyclists.</p>

	<p>Joining the San Francisco Cycling Club requires two existing members to 
		vouch for you. We trust our members to bring in good people who value <a href="/about">our values</a>.
		
	<p>If you've not ridden with any of us before, just 
		come along to <a href="/rides-calendar">our rides</a>, introduce yourself and make a couple 
		of new friends. We're very welcoming to new folks.</p>

	<p>New membership costs <strong>$120/year</strong>, it's active immediately (2014 membership opened November 2013) 
		and expires at the end of each calendar year.</p>
	
	<p>SFCC is non-binding. Being part of the club doesn't preclude you joining a racing team or a social club.</p>

	<h3>Where your Money Goes</h3>

	<p>Membership fees will be used to fund and subsidise club kit, put money on the bar at social events, 
		buy shared equipment, and organize races and events.</p>

	<p>We purposefully have no sponsors and we don't run for profit. Every dime goes back to the Club and its members.</p>
