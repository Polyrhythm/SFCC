	<h2>Rides and Calendar</h2>

	<p>All our upcoming events. These rides aren't necessarily organised by us but you'll often find our members there. 
		Coming along to the rides listed here is the best way to introduce yourself.</p>
		
	<p>Our <a href="http://twitter.com/sfcycling">Twitter account</a> is always our most up to date source of ride 
		information. Please check there to confirm a ride is on before showing up for the first time. Additional 
		rides are always being organised on <a href="/forum">the forum</a>.
